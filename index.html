        <h1>RULES</h1>
        <h3>Objective</h3>
        <p>The objective of Connect Four is to be the first player to connect four of their own colored discs in a
            vertical, horizontal, or diagonal line on the game board.</p>

        <h3>How To Play</h3>
        <section>
            <ul>
                <li>The player who makes the first move every round shifts each game so it is fare for both the players
                </li>
                <li>The chosen disc is dropped from the top of the selected column, and it will fall to the lowest
                    available
                    position within that column.</li>
                <li>Once a disc is placed, it cannot be moved or removed.</li>
                <li>The game continues until one player successfully connects four of their own colored discs in a row.
                </li>
                <li>The connection can be made vertically, horizontally, or diagonally in any direction.</li>
                <li>If a player connects four discs and wins the game.</li>
                <li>If the entire game board is filled with discs, and no player has connected four in a row, the game
                    ends in a tie.</li>
                <li>In the case of a tie, neither player wins, and the game is considered a draw.</li>
            </ul>
